This project is a just a extended version of a project by Timur Kristóf.

I added:
  * GUI features (menu bar, choosing size of game board, etc.)
  * Two-player support (integrated into GUI)
  * Ability to choose number of cards (default is 2x4)
  * Fixed clicking animation to be more into the board, rather than into the board and to the side slightly
